1. Bitcoin uses a proof of work consensus mechanism; Ethereum uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism. 

2. The primary use of Bitcoin is as a currency; Ethereum is more inclined to support decentralized applications.

3. Transactions on the Ethereum network may contain executable code; information attached to transactions on the Bitcoin network is only used in transactions records.

4. Bitcoin uses SHA-256; Ethereum uses LMDGhost.

5. Bitcoin: the more transaction fees a person pays, the quicker the transactions get validated and added in a block; Ethereum uses an A-gas system in place of transaction fees: fees are based on estimation of the volume of computational effort needed to perform specific operations.



Improvements:
- No gas for primitive programs
- Add length checks for dynamic types
- Add type checks at the execution level
